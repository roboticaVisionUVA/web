    The development and experimentation proposed in “ECOSYSTEM OF AMBIENT
    INTELLIGENCE FOR SUPPORTING LONG-TERM CARE AT HOME THROUGH THE USE OF SOCIAL
    ROBOTS ()” is based on a methodology of open innovation and technological
    co-creation with users to generate solutions that foster personal autonomy.
    Recent advancements in healthcare have led to an unprecedented increase in
    the number of older adults. Consequently, in recent years, interest in
    assistive technologies has substantially grown, aimed at helping these
    individuals remain active and live independently, either in their own homes
    or integrated residential units within care centers. This project seeks to
    advance the care and entertainment of older adults through a precise
    combination of social robots, robotic systems for navigation and
    manipulation, and ambient intelligence systems. EIAROB will be deployed in
    real environments, such as residences and day centers, with significant
    experimentation efforts in real operational environments. To achieve this,
    the project will include researchers from the University of Valladolid and
    social entities that work closely with older adults, as well as technology
    companies that will support the development and scalability of the proposed
    solutions. The project promotes the creation of a complete ecosystem that
    integrates social robots and ambient intelligence to offer advanced services
    and improve the quality of life of older adults, maintaining its leadership
    in providing innovative services.

    Recent advances in health care have resulted in an unprecedented increase in
    the number of elderly people. Consequently, there is a growing interest in
    assistive technologies that help these people remain active and live
    independently, in their own home or in coexistence units integrated in
    residential centres. Within this context, ROSOGAR aims to explore new
    solutions based on social robots and other robotic and monitoring systems to
    support the provision of social services, with a special emphasis on long-
    term care and domestic environments. The project involves the development,
    integration and validation of robotic platforms and intelligent environments
    in real scenarios, in collaboration with social service providers and
    research centres. Its goal is to improve the autonomy and well-being of
    older people, as well as to support professionals and caregivers through
    technology. (Developed at CARTIF)

  description: >
    The 5R Project, funded by Spain's Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness,
    focuses on developing technologies and methodologies that support the
    transformation of production systems towards smarter, more flexible and
    sustainable manufacturing. The project promotes the integration of
    automation, robotics, data analytics and cyber-physical systems in industry.
    Its main goals include improving the efficiency and adaptability of
    production lines, facilitating human-robot collaboration and introducing new
    approaches to maintenance and quality control. The work includes
    demonstration pilots in real industrial environments to validate the
    developed solutions. (Developed at CARTIF)

  description: >
    SRURAL aims to reduce the digital divide between urban and rural
    environments by deploying advanced ICT infrastructures and services in rural
    areas. The project focuses on smart territories, using sensor networks, data
    platforms and communication technologies to improve key sectors such as
    agriculture, environment, energy and tourism. It seeks to enhance the
    quality of life of rural populations, promote sustainable development and
    support local administrations in decision-making. (Developed at CARTIF)

    AGROVIS develops advanced computer vision and artificial intelligence
    systems for quality control and process monitoring in the agri-food sector.
    The project addresses tasks such as visual inspection, defect detection,
    classification and traceability of products, with the aim of increasing
    efficiency and ensuring food safety. The solutions are designed to be
    integrated into production lines and work in real time, supporting both
    large industries and small and medium-sized enterprises. (Developed at CARTIF)

  description: >
    AIROSO is a project focused on the use of robotics and intelligent systems
    for the care of dependent people, particularly in socio-health environments
    such as nursing homes and centres for the elderly. The project combines
    social robots, service robots and ambient intelligence to offer support in
    daily activities, cognitive stimulation and monitoring of users' well-being.
    It has been recognised by the DomusVi Foundation for its contribution to the
    socio-health sector, highlighting its potential impact on the quality of
    life of dependent people and the work of professionals. (Developed at CARTIF)

  description: >
    ROASIS focuses on the design and deployment of robotic and sensing systems
    that support care for elderly and dependent people in their own homes or
    residential environments. The project integrates mobile platforms, social
    robots and monitoring technologies to detect risky situations, remind users
    of tasks and therapies and provide cognitive and social stimulation. It aims
    to create safer, more supportive living environments that promote autonomy
    and delay the need for institutionalization. (Developed at CARTIF)

  description: >
    The RURITAGE project, funded by the European Union's Horizon 2020 program,
    focuses on rural regeneration through cultural and natural heritage (CNH). It
    identifies 13 rural areas as Role Models, showcasing successful CNH-driven
    regeneration in six innovation areas: Pilgrimage, Resilience, Local Food,
    Landscape, Management, Migration, and Art & Festivals. These best practices
    are transferred to six Replicators, rural territories developing their own
    heritage-led strategies to enhance skills, knowledge, and capacity building.
